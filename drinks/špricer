 The white wine spritzer is a classic drink and one of the easiest cocktails you can mix together. It requires just two ingredients and is a fantastic way to dress up and add sparkle to any white wine.

The true beauty of the spritzer is that it will work with any white wine varietal you have on hand. Though riesling, pinot grigio, and sauvignon blanc are used most often, you'll also find that a chardonnay or gew√ºrtztraminer is nice as well. While you can vary the ratio to fit your taste and a particular wine, it's often best to begin with a 3:1 pour of 1 part soda or water for every 3 parts of wine. 

The white wine spritzer is an uncomplicated drink, but it's also a nice foundation for a few enhancements. With the right garnish or some fruity ice, it can be just as impressive as any other cocktail.
